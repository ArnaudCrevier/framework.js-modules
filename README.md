# framework.js: Modules [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

#### Version 1.1

##### Works with Deux Huit Huit's framework version 1.3

Collections of files we frequently use with our framework.

Files are seperated into groups:

### Modules

Modules are singletons across the framework

### Components

Components are modules that are created and reference by the page or other components.

### Pages

Pages represent a page model associated with one or more routes.

### Transitions

Transitions represent the way things are animated when changing from a page to another.

### Utils

Utils are some jQuery plugins/facilitator that won't fit elsewhere.
