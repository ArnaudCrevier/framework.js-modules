# framework.js: Modules [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js-modules.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js-modules) [![David DM](https://david-dm.org/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js-modules/dev-status.svg?style=flat)](https://david-dm.org/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js-modules#info=devDependencies)

##### Works with the latest version of [Deux Huit Huit's framework](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js).

Collections of files we frequently use with our framework.

Files are separated into groups:

### Modules

Modules are singletons across the framework

### Components

Components are modules that are created and reference by the page or other components.

### Pages

Pages represent a page model associated with one or more routes.

### Transitions

Transitions represent the way things are animated when changing from a page to another.

### Utils

Utils are some jQuery plugins/facilitator that won't fit elsewhere.
